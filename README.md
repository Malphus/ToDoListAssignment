# ToDoListAssignment
Uses starter code from MITxPro bootcamp for To Do list.  I am updating the styling.

I would like to add an undo feature, so if a task is marked complete on accident, it can be undone rather than having to add the task again.  Or make it so the tasks are marked or unmarked when clicked and tasks are fully removed when updated.
